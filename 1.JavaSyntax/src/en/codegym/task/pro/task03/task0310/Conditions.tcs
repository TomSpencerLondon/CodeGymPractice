This program is written using the ternary operator, but it&#39;s not clear what it does. We think that the code will become much clearer if we get rid of the ternary operator.
Rewrite the program without using the ternary operator.


Требования:
1.	The program should read a number from the keyboard.
2.	Instead of a ternary operator, the program should use an if statement.
3.	The functionality of the program must not change.
